🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detector
A lightweight web app for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model.

🔍 Project Overview
This app allows users to input features of a credit card transaction and receive a prediction (Fraud or Not Fraud). Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit, it provides a user-friendly web interface for real-time fraud detection.

🚀 Features
Interactive Web UI: Easily input transaction data via a clean, organized form.

ML-Powered Detection: Backed by a pre-trained model stored in credit_card_fraud_model.pkl.

Instant Feedback: Simulates real-time analysis with quick predictions.

Deployable on Hugging Face Spaces: Get the model running as a hosted app with minimal setup.

🧰 Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

Familiarity with pip and virtual environments

⚙️ Installation & Run
Clone the repo

git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ankush02/credit_card_fraud_detector
cd credit_card_fraud_detector


Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app locally
streamlit run app.py


Visit the app
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to try out the fraud detector.

🧠 How It Works (app.py)
Load Model: Reads the credit_card_fraud_model.pkl file using pickle.

User Input UI: Streamlit widgets collect numeric transaction features.

Prediction Logic: Passes inputs to the model; displays “Fraud” or “Not Fraud”.

Results Display: Shows prediction and confidence levels instantly.

⚙️ Dependencies

🧬 Model Details
Algorithm: Scikit-Learn classifier (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or similar).

Training Data: Commonly used credit card fraud datasets.

Serialized Model File: credit_card_fraud_model.pkl.

📌 Usage Example
Start the app.

Enter transaction feature values (e.g., V1, V2, Amount, etc.).

Click Predict.

View the fraud risk prediction immediately.

📈 Deployment
To host on Hugging Face Spaces:

Ensure the repository includes app.py, requirements.txt, and model pickle.

Connect your Space to this repo.

Hugging Face will automatically install dependencies and launch the app.
